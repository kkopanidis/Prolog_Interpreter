# Prolog_Interpreter
A prolog Interpreter created for the Artificial Intelligence course @ Athens University of Economics and Business.
The interpreter is not errorless, and a lot of features are missing to support the full prolog language. The demands of the project,
were for the interpreter to use the fol-bc-ask algorithm, and support simple operations with facts and rules, and simple lists.
